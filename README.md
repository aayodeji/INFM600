Question 4:
New Question: What is the Park to Restaurant ratio in the Cities of Howard County?

I would prefer to view the results of this question on a map. I believe this will be the best way to display the results because a map offers a real-time visual of each Restaurant and Park. To facilitate analysis of the data, there should be a map key that displays each park location in a particular color and each restaurant location in a particular color. There should also be geographical lines that border the outline of each city. This way, one will be able to clearly see each park and restaurant in each city within Howard County.
